ACCC  |  How to spot and avoid scamsHelp is at hand
If you’re reading this, chances are you, or 
someone you know has been the target 
of a scammer. Unfortunately, you’re not 
alone. Scams are getting more and more 
sophisticated which means anyone can 
be a victim.
If you have been scammed, it’s important you act quickly.
If you’ve given banking information or had money stolen by a 
scammer, contact your bank or card provider first.
Contact IDCARE, 1800 595 160 , www.id care.org . 
Scams succeed because they look like the real thing. Scammers 
rely on you not spotting warning signs because you’re in a hurry, 
something looks like a great deal you don’t want to miss, or 
because it seems like it’s from someone you trust.

ACCC  |  How to spot and avoid scamsProtect yourself from scams by following 
these 3 steps:
StopDon’t give money or personal 
information to anyone if unsure.

to verify who you are. They will pretend to 
be from organisations you know and trust 
like service providers, the police, your bank 
or government services.
CheckAsk yourself could the message  
or call be fake?
Never click a link in a message. Only 
contact businesses or government using 
contact information that you find yourself 
from their official website or app. If you’re 
not sure, say ‘no’, hang up or delete.
Protect Act quickly if something feels wrong.
Contact your bank if you notice unusual 
activity or if a scammer gets your money or 
information. Seek help and report the scam 
to ReportCyber and Scamwatch. When you 
report scams, you help us stop the scam 
and warn others.

ACCC  |  How to spot and avoid scamsWhat is a scam
A scam is when someone deceives you to steal 
your money or personal information. 
Scams are economic crimes run by criminals who are often very 
organised and sophisticated. 
Computer

terms Harassing marketing 
approachesA scam is NOT:
It’s important to remember that not all negative experiences are 
scams. You might have paid for a product that you never received 
or bought something and found the quality was poor. While this 
is disappointing, they are not necessarily scams. The Australian 
Consumer Law offers protections to Australian consumers for 
these sorts of issues.

ACCC  |  How to spot and avoid scamsHow to spot and 
avoid scams
Scams can happen to all of us. Scams work 
because scammers create believable stories 
to steal your money and get your personal 
information.
Scammers are getting smarter and taking advantage of new 
technology, products, services, and major events to convince you 
that their scams are real.
It can be very hard to spot a scam. Here are some situations 
to watch out for. Sometimes scammers use a combination of 
these tactics.
1. Opportunities to make or save money: Scammers will 
deceive you into believing you’re getting an incredible deal 
or offer. They will put pressure on you to act quickly so you 
don’t miss out. Remember, deals that seem too good to be 
true, usually are.
2. Sad stories and cries for help: Scammers will try and use 
your good nature against you. They will share stories of 
heartbreak and tragedy with you and explain why they need 
your help and your money.
3. Links and attachments:  Scammers use links to send you 
to scam websites designed to steal your information and 
money. Scammers may also ask you to open attachments. 
These can install viruses that steal your information. 

5
ACCC  |  How to spot and avoid scams4. Pressure to act quickly: Scammers don’t want you to take 
your time and think things through. They want to pressure 
you into acting quickly. This can include making threats that 
something bad will happen if you don’t act fast.
5. Requests that you pay in unusual or specific ways:  
Scammers often ask you to pay using uncommon methods 
like preloaded debit cards, iTunes cards, or virtual currency 
like Bitcoin. Once this money is spent, you can’t get it back.
6. Request to set up new accounts or PayIDs: Scammers may 
ask you to set up a new bank account or PayID in order to 
pay them (or be paid by them). They may pretend to be your 
bank and tell you to transfer your money into new accounts 
to keep it safe. 
If scammers have succeeded in taking your money, they will try to 
get more money from you. Unfortunately, one in three scam victims 
have been scammed more than once. If scammers have stolen 
your money, be on the lookout for scammers offering to help you 
get your money back. This is another kind of follow-up scam.

ACCC  |  How to spot and avoid scamsText or SMS scams 
Scammers send messages pretending to be 
from the government, law enforcement, trusted 
businesses, or even your own family or friends.
These messages will sound urgent and try to get you to act 
quickly. They will often have a link which will take you to a scam 
website. Scammers can steal any personal information entered 
on these scam websites and use it to take your money or commit 
fraud in your name.
To make these messages seem real, scammers copy or disguise 
their phone number behind the phone number and caller ID of 
legitimate businesses or people you know.
Scam messages can even appear in the same message chain 
as real messages from the organisation, making them even 
harder to spot.

ACCC  |  How to spot and avoid scamsSteps to protect yourself from 
messaging scams
1. If someone you know sends a message to say 
they have a new phone number:
a. try to call them on the existing number you 
have for them, or 
b. message them on the new number with a 
question only they would know the answer 
to, to check they are who they say they are.
2. Never click on links in messages. 
3. If a message links to a website, don’t click the 
link. Instead, search for the website yourself 
online, or use the official app. 
4. Don’t respond to a text message using the 
phone number provided. 
5. Call the organisation or person back on a 
phone number you have found yourself, such

11
ACCC  |  How to spot and avoid scamsEmail scams
Scammers send emails pretending to be 
from the government, law enforcement and 
businesses. They make it sound urgent to get 
you to act quickly.
Scammers use the same logo and a similar email address as the 
real organisation. Scammers can also copy or disguise their email 
address behind the email address of an organisation or business 
to make the scam email look more real.

12
ACCC  |  How to spot and avoid scamsSigns an email might be a scam
The email:
Requests a payment but the account details are 
new or have changed since the last payment you 
made.
Asks you to log on to an online account with 
your username and password or to provide other 
personal information.
Was unexpected and includes an attachment with 
an invitation to open it.
Asks you to confirm your banking details to 
receive a refund or money you are not expecting.
Claims to have information about you or images of 
you and threatens to release them.
Offers to help you recover money or get 
compensation for a data breach or identity theft.
13
ACCC  |  How to spot and avoid scamsSteps to protect yourself from email scams
1. Check that the email is real by:
	contacting the person or organisation 
directly using contact details you’ve found 
yourself such as from the organisation’s 
website or via their official app (never via 
a link).
2. Immediately stop contact with anyone who 
tries to threaten or intimidate you.
3. Never give personal details or pay anyone 
offering you:
a. compensation or help to recover from a 
previous scam or data breach or,
b. winnings, prizes or an inheritance.
4. Use multi-factor authentication when you can. 
This provides an extra layer of protection and 
means a scammer has to know your email 
password and a pin number sent to your phone 
to gain access to your email account.

21
ACCC  |  How to spot and avoid scamsSteps to protect yourself from 
website scams
1. Compare prices. If an offer appears too good 
to be true, it probably is.
2. Research the organisation or person you are 
dealing with before giving your money or 
personal information.
3. Don’t rely on reviews written on the website 
itself. Search the website or business name 
and the word ‘scam’ or ‘reviews’.
4. If a warning or error message pops up on 
your screen don’t click on it, instead go to 
the application it refers to directly to check if 
it is real. 
5. Keep the device you use for online shopping 
up to date by enabling ‘automatic updates’ for 
your operating system and apps.

Social media,  
app-based and online 
messaging scams
If someone you don’t know contacts you 
on social media, a messaging platform 
like WhatsApp or WeChat, or via an app, it 
could be a scam. 
Scammers pretending to be someone else will often use the real 
photo of the person or official logo of the organisation they are 
pretending to be, to make the scam harder to spot. 
Scammers on social media will set up fake profiles and pretend 
to be from the government, a real business, employer, investment 
firm, or even a friend, family member or romantic interest. 
They may impersonate famous people and make it look like they 
are promoting goods or services. 
Scammers can also learn a lot about you from details you share 
on your social media accounts. They can use this information to 
guess your account passwords or target you with other scams.  

24

25
ACCC  |  How to spot and avoid scamsSteps to protect yourself from social media 
and app-based scams
1. Check if the profile might be fake. Is the 
account active? How many friends/followers 
do they have and how much do they 
post online? 
2. Search the name of the profile online together 
with the word ‘scam.’ 
3. Never take a job you were offered without an 
interview, or discussion about your experience, 
suitability, and references. Research the 
recruiter and the business or individual 
offering the position. Contact the recruitment 
agency via phone numbers sourced from an 
independent internet search.  
Don’t pay money up front just to secure a job.
4. Only take investment advice from someone 
with an Australian Financial Services license  
and check that a company or website is not 
named on the International Organization of 
Securities Commission’s (IOSCO) investor 
alerts portal.
5. Never give money to a person you have only 
met online. Scammers often say they live 
overseas and can’t meet you in person.
6. Never send intimate pictures of yourself to 
someone you have only met online.

genuine messages from an organisation.

steal your money. They go to great lengths to convince you the 
relationship is real and manipulate you to give them money.
